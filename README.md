### Unrealfit is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [React web development library](https://react.dev/). React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, known for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering using a virtual DOM.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL for querying, managing, and storing structured data efficiently.
